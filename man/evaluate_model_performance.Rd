\title{Evaluate Model Performance}
\usage{
evaluate_model_performance(fit_result, dataset, response_var, predictor_vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_result}{A list containing the results from a linear regression model.}

\item{dataset}{The dataset used to fit the model.}

\item{response_var}{The name of the response variable.}

\item{predictor_vars}{A vector of predictor variables.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
- R_squared: The R-squared value
- Adj_R_squared: The Adjusted R-squared value
- F_statistic: The F-statistic value
- p_value_F: The p-value for the F-statistic
}
\description{
This function evaluates the performance of a linear regression model by computing essential
metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, F-statistic, and its associated p-value. These
metrics allow us to assess how well the model fits the data and whether the predictors significantly
explain the variability in the response variable.
}
\details{
The R-squared and adjusted R-squared quantify the proportion of variance explained by the model,
while the F-statistic and its p-value test the overall significance of the regression model.
